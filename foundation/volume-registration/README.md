# Volume registration

This directory contains a script (`find_transform.py`) to find a transform between a fixed Zarr volume and a moving source.
The moving source can be either another Zarr volume or a Neuroglancer-loadable VTK mesh.
It runs a local [neuroglancer](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer) instance to display the data and adds functionality to find a transform by manual alignment.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Example invocation:

```bash
python -i find_transform.py \
--fixed SCROLLS_HEL_4.681um_113keV_1.2m_binmean_2_PHerc_0500P2_HA_0001_masked.zarr/ \
--fixed-voxel-size 9.362 \
--moving PHerc500P2-0.5um_masked.zarr/ \
--output-transform output_transform.json \
--initial-transform initial_transform.json
```

### Example invocation with a moving mesh:

```bash
python -i find_transform.py \
--fixed SCROLLS_HEL_4.681um_113keV_1.2m_binmean_2_PHerc_0500P2_HA_0001_masked.zarr/ \
--fixed-voxel-size 9.362 \
--moving /absolute/path/to/MAN5_scaled.vtk \
--moving-type mesh \
--moving-source-unit-size 1000 \
--output-transform output_transform.json
```

If `--moving` points to a local `.vtk` file, the script automatically serves its directory over a local HTTP server with CORS enabled and passes the resulting `vtk://http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...` URL to Neuroglancer.
In mesh mode, the tool also overlays live intersection contours of the moving mesh in the orthogonal slice views using annotation lines in fixed-space coordinates.
Use `--mesh-slice-max-segments` to reduce the number of contour segments kept in that overlay if you want a lighter-weight slice rendering path. The default is `256`.
Live pan/slice tracking for that mesh slice overlay is enabled when `numba` is available.

### Overview

Typically one finds a transform by following these steps (details below):

- Performing a coarse initial alignment by rotating, translating, and flipping the moving source using keybinds until it roughly aligns with the fixed volume.
- Adding manual landmark points to each source based on visual features, refining the alignment.
- (Optional and not recommended at this time) Using SimpleITK to fit a transform. The current implementation uses low-resolution levels of the Zarr input volumes, and does not result in precise transforms.

#### Visualization

- `c` - Toggle volume color

#### Coarse initial alignment

First one roughly positions the moving source using the following commands:

- Step sizes can be customized via `--small-rotate-deg`, `--large-rotate-deg`, `--small-translate-voxels`, and `--large-translate-voxels`.
- `Alt + a` - Rotate +X (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + q` - Rotate -X (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + s` - Rotate +Y (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + w` - Rotate -Y (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + d` - Rotate +Z (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + e` - Rotate -Z (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + f` - Flip X
- `Alt + g` - Flip Y
- `Alt + h` - Flip Z
- `Alt + j` - Translate +X (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + u` - Translate -X (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + k` - Translate +Y (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + i` - Translate -Y (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + l` - Translate +Z (`+ Shift` for bigger step)
- `Alt + o` - Translate -Z (`+ Shift` for bigger step)

#### Adding landmark points

Next, landmark points are added to each source based on visual features.
These refine the transform.
After there are sufficient pairs of landmark points (4+ in unconstrained mode, 3+ in constrained mode), the transform is automatically fit to the landmark points each time a point pair is added.

- `Alt + 1` - Add landmark point to fixed volume at cursor position
- `Alt + 2` - Add landmark point to moving volume at cursor position

#### Refining landmark points

- Point perturb step can be customized via `--point-perturb-voxels`.
- `Alt + x` - Delete nearest landmark point
- `Alt + [` - Navigate to previous fixed point
- `Alt + ]` - Navigate to next fixed point
- `Shift + j` - Perturb fixed point +X
- `Shift + u` - Perturb fixed point -X
- `Shift + k` - Perturb fixed point +Y
- `Shift + i` - Perturb fixed point -Y
- `Shift + l` - Perturb fixed point +Z
- `Shift + o` - Perturb fixed point -Z

#### Reviewing landmark errors

After the transform is fit from landmarks, a **landmark errors** layer appears in the neuroglancer viewer showing the registration error for each landmark pair. The error is the distance (in voxels) between the fixed landmark and the corresponding moving landmark after transformation.

- Points are **color-coded** from green (low error) to red (high error), with marker size scaling with error magnitude.
- The neuroglancer **side panel** (click the `landmark_errors` layer) shows a table of all points with their error values. Click a column header to sort, and click a row to navigate to that point.
- A **summary table** is also printed to the terminal each time errors update, showing all landmarks sorted by error along with RMS and max error.
- `Alt + Shift + ]` - Navigate to the landmark with the largest error

This is useful for identifying landmarks that may need adjustment, or for spotting regions where a non-affine transform might be needed.

#### Constrained fit mode

By default, landmark fitting uses an unconstrained 12 DOF affine (requires 4+ point pairs). For volumes that share physical constraints — roughly aligned z-axis, isotropic scaling, rotation mainly around z — a **constrained fit mode** is available that fits only 5 continuous parameters: isotropic scale, z-rotation angle, and 3D translation. It additionally tries all 8 axis flip combinations (independent ±1 on each axis) and picks the best. This requires only 3+ point pairs.

- `m` - Toggle between constrained and unconstrained fit mode
- `--constrained-fit` - Start in constrained fit mode

#### Automatically refining the transform
> **_NOTE:_**  Not particularly recommended, as the current implementation uses low-resolution levels of the Zarr input volumes, and does not result in precise transforms.

The transform can be automatically refined using image registration via SimpleITK.
This is only available when the moving source is also a Zarr volume.
The registration method uses the lower resolution Zarr levels and the Mattes mutual information metric to register the volumes.

- `f` - Fit the transform to the landmark points using SimpleITK

#### Saving the transform

- `w` - Write the current transform to the output file. This also prints a shareable neuroglancer URL that can be used to view the volumes with the transform applied.

## Checking cross-scan placement of a segment

`check_placement.py` checks whether one segment's surface volumes on two scans of the same scroll show the same
papyrus. It resamples both to a shared (u, v, depth) grid in micrometres, using each OME-Zarr's scale, and reports
for random windows the normalised cross-correlation (NCC) with no shift and at the best depth and in-plane shift.

```bash
S=https://vesuvius-challenge-open-data.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/PHerc0139/segments/20250108000002-w027_2025010845/surface-volumes
python check_placement.py \
--reference $S/2.399um-0.22m-78keV-volume-20260102150214.zarr \
--other $S/1.129um-0.22m-59keV-volume-20260413113053-L1.zarr
```

Each `--other` gets one line with the median NCC with no shift, at the best shift, the median in-plane shift and a
verdict: `placed`, `same sheet, offset` (best NCC of 0.4 or more at a shift larger than one grid cell), or
`no match within the search range` (for example the PHerc1667 1.129 um surface volumes, villa #1843).
`--output report.json` keeps the per-window numbers. Tests: `python -m pytest test_check_placement.py`.
